--INSTALLATION STEPS--

1. Download Python 3.10 or later at https://www.python.org/. (Make sure during installation you add Python to PATH)
2. If you want to edit the code by adding in different codenames, open up the 'main.py' file in a text editor and it should show the space where you add in the categories and words.
3. To run the generator, open your command prompt and type in 'cd C:\Users\user\Downloads\Python-Codename-Generator' (folder name may vary based on repo) and type 'python tk-main.py'. This should run the codename generator. If you want to run it WITHOUT the GUI, type in 'C:\Codename Generator\Python-Codename-Generator\without tkinter' and type in 'python notk-main.py'
